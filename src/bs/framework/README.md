> Used Design Patterns: Observer, Account, Simple Factory, Strategy, Singleton, Proxy 

####Observer Pattern
> We used this pattern to implement addInterest Function. All accounts are observers when user clicks addInterest button it will invoke.

####Account Pattern
> We used this pattern to generalize the common Account infos.

####Simple Factory
> We used this pattern to create Person or Company type of Customer. 

####Strategy Pattern
> We used this pattern to change the strategy of withDraw and Deposit functions. We have one common function and when we implement this pattern we can change the strategy.

####Proxy Pattern
> We used this pattern to implement the logging and notifying customer functions. After calling the function itself we do logging and call the message methods. These methods are receiving Predicate, so in this case we generalize. P2C -> P2I

####Singleton Pattern
> We used this pattern to save history. If we save history then we can generate reports easily.
